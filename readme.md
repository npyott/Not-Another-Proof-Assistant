# Not Another Proof Assistant

This small project is a simple proof assistant based upon lambda calculus.
It is meant as an exercise in building a proof assistant, starting with a core layer and hopefully building up to an Isabelle/ISAR style metalanguage.

The core project is currently written in TypeScript,
though this may be changed at a later date.
